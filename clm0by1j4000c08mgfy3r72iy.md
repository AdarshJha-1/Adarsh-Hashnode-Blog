```bash
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout your source code from a Git repository
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Compile and build your project (replace with your build tool)
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run automated tests (replace with your testing framework)
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            steps {
                // Deploy to a staging environment (replace with your deployment process)
                sh 'ansible-playbook deploy-staging.yml'
            }
        }
        
        stage('User Acceptance Testing (UAT)') {
            steps {
                // Perform user acceptance tests in the staging environment
                sh 'robot uat_tests.robot'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy to Production') {
            when {
                // Define conditions for deploying to production (e.g., manual approval)
                expression { currentBuild.resultIsBetterOrEqualTo('SUCCESS') }
            }
            steps {
                // Deploy to the production environment (replace with your deployment process)
                sh 'ansible-playbook deploy-production.yml'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Post-Deployment Cleanup') {
            steps {
                // Perform any post-deployment cleanup or notifications
                sh 'echo "Deployment to production is complete."'
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        success {
            // Define actions to be taken on successful completion of all stages
            echo 'CI/CD Pipeline completed successfully!'
        }
        
        failure {
            // Define actions to be taken on pipeline failure
            echo 'CI/CD Pipeline failed. Please investigate.'
        }
    }
}
```

This Jenkins Pipeline script represents a basic CI/CD workflow with various stages, including source code checkout, building, testing, deploying to staging and production, and performing post-deployment tasks. It also includes a `post` section to define actions based on the pipeline's success or failure.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you should adapt the script to your specific project's requirements, tools, and deployment processes. Jenkins Pipeline offers flexibility for customizing CI/CD workflows to suit your needs. 🔄🚀🛠️
