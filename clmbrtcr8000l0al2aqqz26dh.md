## **Introduction üåê**

In today's fast-paced digital world, data is the lifeblood of many organizations. Storing, managing, and scaling databases efficiently are essential for businesses to thrive. This is where Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) steps in as a game-changer. In this blog, we'll explore the world of Amazon RDS, its core features, benefits, and why it's become an indispensable tool for businesses operating in the cloud.

## **What is Amazon RDS? üõ¢Ô∏è**

### **Step 5: Set Up EC2 Connection with MySQL RDS**

1. **Go to RDS:** Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS RDS service.
    
2. **Select Your Database:** From the RDS dashboard, select the RDS instance associated with your MySQL database.
    
3. **Access EC2 Connection Setup:** In the RDS instance details page, click on the "Database" section on the left sidebar. Then, under the "Instance actions" dropdown, select "Set up EC2 connection."
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694247029377/761157e6-9a5d-4f4e-9303-5d35b1df073f.png align="center")
    
4. **Choose an EC2 Instance:** In the "Set up EC2 connection" wizard, you will see a list of available EC2 instances in your AWS account. Choose the EC2 instance that you want to associate with the RDS instance for direct connectivity.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694247064578/e969ff39-a955-48dd-b6bf-75eb62ee37ad.png align="center")
    
5. **Press Continue:** After selecting the EC2 instance, press the "Continue" button to proceed.
    

By following these steps, you are associating the chosen EC2 instance with your RDS instance, allowing for direct network connectivity between them. This can be useful when you want to establish more secure and efficient communication between your EC2 instance and RDS database, bypassing the public internet.

### **Step 6: Connect EC2 to RDS Using MySQL Client**

1. SSH into your EC2 instance using the key pair you saved during the EC2 instance setup.
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-ip
    ```
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694245003652/a6c5ff61-cc0b-45bc-b862-cf650c95d710.png align="center")
    
2. Update your EC2 instance by running:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update -y
    ```
    
3. Install the MySQL client on your EC2 instance:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install mysql-server -y
    ```
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694245301820/51d023b0-c631-4a87-b6fc-01bd15cb4a75.png align="center")
    
4. Connect to your RDS MySQL instance using the credentials you noted in Step 1:
    
    ```bash
     mysql -h <endpoint address> -P <port.no> -u <username> -p
    ```
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694247106616/ebd2a2a8-373e-493c-8bfa-4a75001f4cc9.png align="center")
    
5. Enter the MySQL password when prompted.
    
6. You are now connected to your RDS MySQL instance via your EC2 instance using the MySQL client.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694246593627/b57f1d2c-5d4a-4628-9b5b-7ebc2b7cee07.png align="center")
    

Congratulations! You've completed the setup of an RDS MySQL instance, an EC2 instance, and an IAM role with RDS access, and successfully connected your EC2 instance to the RDS MySQL server using a MySQL client. This demonstrates your ability to configure AWS services for database access and EC2 instance connectivity.
