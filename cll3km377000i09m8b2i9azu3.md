## 1\. What is Git and why is it important?

Git is like a digital time machine for your code 🕰️. It helps programmers work on projects together, keeping track of changes they make 📝. Git is important because it lets you collaborate without messing up each other's work, and you can always go back to older versions if something goes wrong 🔄.

## 2. What is the difference **be**tween Main Branch and Master Branch?

Think of them like different names for the same thing 🔄. "Master" used to be a common name, but now many use "Main" to be more respectful. Both are default branches in Git where your latest code lives 🌱.

## 3\. Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is the tool that helps manage versions of your code, while GitHub is like a website where you can store and share your code with others 🏪. Think of Git as the toolbox and GitHub as the workshop where you show your projects.

## 4. How do you create **a** new repository on GitHub**?**

It's like making a new online folder for your code 📁. You go to GitHub, click on "New," give your repository a name and description, decide if it's public or private 🔐, and then create it. Now you have a place to store your code online!

## 5\. What is the difference between a local & remote repository? How to connect local to remote?

A local repository is on your own computer 🖥️, while a remote repository is stored on a server (like GitHub) 🌐. Connecting them is like setting up a bridge. First, you copy the remote repository's URL. Then, in your local repository, you run a command to add that URL as a "remote." After that, you can send your code from local to remote using commands like "git push" 📤. It's like sharing your local project with others on the web!

## Task 1: Set your user name and email address

Open your terminal or command prompt and enter these commands, replacing `"Your Name"` and `"`[`your@email.com`](mailto:your@email.com)`"` with your actual name and email address:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

**To check the configured user name and email address**

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

3. Name your repository "Devops" and add a description if you'd like.
    
4. Choose the repository visibility (public or private).
    
5. You can choose to initialize the repository with a README file, but for now, let's skip that.
    
6. Click "Create repository."

## Task 3: Connect your local repository to GitHub

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your local repository.
    
2. Run these commands:
    

```bash
git init  # Initialize a new Git repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/Devops.git
```

Replace `"YourUsername"` with your actual GitHub username.

## Task 4: Create a new file and add content

1. In your terminal, navigate to your local repository's directory.
    
2. Create the necessary folders and the file:
    

```bash
mkdir -p Devops/Git  # Create the required folders
touch Devops/Git/Day-02.txt  # Create the Day-02.txt file
```

1. Open the `Day-02.txt` file in a text editor and add some content.
    

## Task 5: Push your local commits to GitHub

1. In your terminal, navigate to your local repository's directory.
    
2. Run these commands:
    

```bash
git add .  # Stage all changes for commit
git commit -m "Added Day-02.txt and content"  # Commit your changes
git push -u origin master  # Push your changes to the GitHub repository
```

If you encounter issues, ensure you've followed each step correctly and that your GitHub credentials are properly configured on your local machine.
