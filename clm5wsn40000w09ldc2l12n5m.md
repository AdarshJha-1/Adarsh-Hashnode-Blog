## **Chapter 1: Introduction to AWS EC2 Automation 🚀**

Welcome to the world of AWS cloud and automation! 🌟 If you're embarking on a journey with AWS and are looking to harness the power of automation, you're in the right place. In this blog series, we'll explore the wonders of automating tasks in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), one of AWS's flagship services.

## **Chapter 2: The Power of Automation in EC2 🤖**

Amazon EC2, or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, offers a versatile and robust computing infrastructure that is secure, reliable, high-performing, and cost-effective. It's the go-to choice for businesses with diverse computing needs. The best part? You can make your AWS experience even better by harnessing the power of automation.

Automation allows you to streamline and simplify various EC2 processes, making your life as a cloud administrator or developer much easier. Whether you're managing instances, optimizing resources, or ensuring consistent configurations, automation has your back.

## **Chapter 3: Launch Templates in AWS EC2 🚀**

Imagine a world where you don't have to tediously input the same configuration details every time you start a new EC2 instance. That's the power of launch templates.

**Launch Templates** in AWS EC2 enable you to create pre-configured templates that store essential information needed to start an instance. This information can include the AMI ID, instance type, network settings, and more. Instead of manually specifying these details each time, you simply refer to your launch template, and EC2 takes care of the rest.

Intrigued? You should be! Launch templates can save you time, reduce the risk of configuration errors, and ensure consistency across your instances.

## **Chapter 4: Understanding EC2 Instance Types 💡**

Amazon EC2 provides a vast array of **instance types** optimized for various use cases. These instance types offer different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. With this flexibility, you have the freedom to choose the perfect blend of resources for your specific applications.

Whether you're running compute-intensive workloads, memory-hungry applications, or need a balance of both, there's an EC2 instance type tailored to your needs. The ability to choose from multiple instance sizes within each type further fine-tunes your resource allocation.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the diverse world of EC2 instance types and help you discover which one suits your workload the best:

## **Chapter 5: Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - The Backbone of Your Instances 🖼️**

Every EC2 instance starts with an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**. An AMI is a pre-configured image provided and maintained by AWS, containing all the necessary information to launch an instance. When you launch an EC2 instance, you select an AMI that serves as the blueprint for your virtual machine.

AMI simplifies the process of deploying multiple instances with identical configurations. Instead of painstakingly configuring each instance manually, you can create an AMI and use it as a template for consistent, repeatable deployments.

In the upcoming chapter, we'll unravel the significance of AMIs and guide you through the steps of creating and utilizing them effectively.

So, buckle up for an exciting journey into the world of AWS EC2 automation. By the end of this blog series, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and skills to supercharge your AWS experience through automation, launch templates, instance types, and Amazon Machine Images. Happy learning! 🚀📚

2. Navigate to the EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service.
    
3. In the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Launch Templates" in the left navigation pane.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693890563822/e033704c-8d7a-4730-8b95-9a2b8cf52ca0.png align="center")
    
4. Click the "Create launch template" button.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693890814456/8cfc59bf-2798-421b-b942-84b5f65b60ac.png align="center")
    
5. Give your launch template a name, e.g., "Jenkins-Docker-Template"
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693890995511/f04de5a1-6615-4a3b-ac20-fe377f05bdc1.png align="center")
    
6. In the "AMI ID" field, select "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS"
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693892971529/bae74c91-1daf-467e-a6d5-6ed67d120525.png align="center")
    
7. In the "Instance type" field, choose "t3.micro."(**I am in** [**Europe (Stockholm)eu-north-1**](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=eu-north-1#CreateTemplate:)**, so it might be different for you based on your selected region)**
