Welcome to the "Test Knowledge on AWS" challenge as part of the 90 Days of DevOps Challenge! In this blog post, we will walk you through a series of tasks designed to test and expand your knowledge of Amazon Web Services (AWS). By the end of this exercise, you will have launched an EC2 instance, installed a web server, deployed a simple web application, and monitored the instance using Amazon CloudWatch.

## **Task: Launching an EC2 Instance, Setting Up a Web Server, and Monitoring with CloudWatchüíª**

## Step 1: Launching an EC2 Instance üíª

The first step is to create an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance using the AWS Management Console. EC2 instances are virtual servers in the cloud that you can configure and manage to run your applications.

1. **Log in to AWS Console**: Open your web browser and navigate to the **AWS** [](https://aws.amazon.com/)**Management** **Console**. Log in with your AWS credentials.

## Step 2: Connecting to Your EC2 Instance üåê

Now that you have an EC2 instance up and running, it's time to connect to it using SSH (Secure Shell).

1. **Open Terminal üñ•Ô∏è**: If you're using Linux or macOS, open your terminal application. If you're on Windows, consider using an SSH client like PuTTY.
    
2. **Change Permissions üîê**: Ensure that your private key (.pem) file is secure by running: `chmod 400 your-key.pem`
    
3. **SSH into Your Instance üö™**: Use the following command to SSH into your instance, replacing `your-key.pem` and `your-instance-ip` with the actual file path and your instance's public IP address:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip
    ```
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694505226428/2c4971a6-0ae5-45a6-82c5-75f3457b5d4c.png align="center")
    
4. You should now be connected to your EC2 instance via SSH.
    

## Step 3: Installing a Web Server and Deploying a Web Application üåê

Now that you're connected to your EC2 instance, let's install a web server and deploy a simple web application. For this example, we'll use Apache as the web server and a basic HTML file.

1. **Update Packages üîÑ**: Run the following command to ensure your system packages are up-to-date:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update -y
    ```
    
2. **Install Apache üåê**: Install the Apache web server with:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install apache2 -y
    ```
